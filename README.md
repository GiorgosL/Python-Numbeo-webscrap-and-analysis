# Python-Numbeo-webscrap-and-modelling

Designed and implemented a __Numbeo__ (https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) webscrapper in order to extract information about a specific city, cost of living index and prices for a number of services and goods related to restaurants, markets, transportation, utilities etc.

__Cost of living index__ 
I
s measured against New York city, meaning NYC has a cost index of 100 and the remaining cities get their cost of living index with regards to how much more or less expensive are compared to NYC.

__Functionality__

Given a list of cities the crawler will retrieve information related to the abovementioned. It will then convert the values and concatenate the retrieved information into a single dataframe.
