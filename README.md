# Python-Numbeo-webscrap-and-analysis

Designed and implemented a __Numbeo__ (https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) webscrapper in order to extract information about a specific city, living cost indxed and prices for a number of services and goods related to restaurants, markets, transportation, utilities etc.

__Cost index__ is measured against New York city meaning NYC has a cost index of 100 and the remaining cities get their cost index with regards to how much more or less expensive are compared to NYC.
