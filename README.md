# Python-Numbeo-webscrap-and-analysis

Designed and implemented a __Numbeo__ (https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) webscrapper in order to extract information about a specific city, cost of living index and prices for a number of services and goods related to restaurants, markets, transportation, utilities etc.

__Cost of living index__ is measured against New York city, meaning NYC has a cost index of 100 and the remaining cities get their cost of living index with regards to how much more or less expensive are compared to NYC.

The scrapped data can be used for visualisation analysis and modelling.
